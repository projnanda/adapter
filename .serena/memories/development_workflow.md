# Development Workflow and Task Completion

## Development Process
1. **Create Custom Improvement Logic**: Write a function that transforms messages
2. **Wrap with NANDA**: Use `NANDA(improvement_function)` to create agent
3. **Configure Environment**: Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and DOMAIN_NAME
4. **Deploy**: Run with `start_server()` or `start_server_api()`
5. **Register**: Agent automatically registers with global registry
6. **Test**: Use provided API endpoints to test functionality

## Testing
- **No formal test suite found** - testing appears to be manual
- Test using the API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/health` - Health check
  - `POST /api/send` - Send message to agent
  - `GET /api/render` - Get latest message

## When Task is Completed
Since no formal testing/linting infrastructure was found:

1. **Manual Testing**: Test the agent using the API endpoints
2. **Check Logs**: Review output logs for errors
3. **Verify Registration**: Ensure agent appears in registry
4. **Test Communication**: Verify agent-to-agent messaging works

## Code Style Observations
- Uses f-strings for string formatting
- Emoji in print statements for user feedback (ðŸ¤–, ðŸš€, âœ…, etc.)
- Environment variables for configuration
- Error handling with try/except blocks
- Type hints in function signatures where applicable
- Docstrings for major functions and classes

## Package Building
```bash
# Build package
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

# Install locally for testing
pip install -e .
```

## Deployment Notes
- Production deployment requires SSL certificates
- Agents run as background processes using nohup
- Logs are written to files for monitoring
- Registry enrollment happens automatically on startup
